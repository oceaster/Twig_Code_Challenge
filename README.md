My solution for the twig code challenge

# How to execute

if you wish to run the example set from main, run the file from your command
line and insert an integer value 'N' after the file name to get your results.

``` bash
python solution.py 10
```

otherwise import the file as a module into your code and use the function as such;

``` python
from solution import divide_sequence

array = [1,2,3]
size = 2

divide_sequence(array, size)
```
